# Binaural Beat Generator
Built without assumptions


## Detail

This project is an explicit record of thought. Making a project without ever assuming what it should be. Instead of planning it out ahead of time, the idea guides the development along with the principle of utmost simplicity.

It's easy to assume as an app developer that everything should be an app. That's also an easy way to overburden yourself and overcomplicate things. This app explores the HTML AudioContext API and is meant to illustrate an idea. A simple way to compose a sequence of binaural beats into a track, much like Tom Campbell's psychic training beats.

## Alternate Version

This project has been restarted [here](https://github.com/maurop123/psychic-beats-maker). This is where the main development of this idea is going on. Go look there.

Also here's an previous version of this project. The first version: https://github.com/maurop123/binaural-beats
